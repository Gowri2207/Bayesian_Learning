# Predict Missing Data in Sensor Measurements

The measurements of five sensor nodes from an IoT deployement for enviroment monitoring where each sensor node is measuring humidity and temperature values, but there are some missing values in collected measurements. 

The goal of this project is to predcit the missing values in sensor measurements.Bayesian methods are used for predicting the values.
